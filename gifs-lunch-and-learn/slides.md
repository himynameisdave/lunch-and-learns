### What about the word "Gin"

Fun fact: Gin is actually pronounced "Gin"

(hard "G")

### Any questions?

Of course not because that's the only way to pronounce it.

## back to the 80's

- PC's were starting to get hot hot hot
- the internet existed, it was still pretty sucky
- lots of text, lots of manually typing commands in (like a chump)
- the dubya dubya dubya did not come along until the early 90s

## CompuServe

- In the late 80's, online-service providers started to emerge
- CompuServe, Quantum Link (later AoL), AppleLink
- The pre-Web way of connecting to people/info via the internet
- basically gave you a "portal"/"sandbox" of internet to play in

## Images

- although there were some significant advancements in computer graphics in the 80's, it was hard to send these across the internet
- the prevailing image format at that time was .rle (run-length encoding)
- black and white only, which as you all know is boring and no fun

## Steve Wilhite

- kind of a goof because he pronounces it "Jif", which as we've learned is incorrect
- on June 15 1987, while working at CompuServe, he created the Gif
- wow cool now you can send people colour images
- wow neat now you can send people animated images

## ...until 1993

- psych!! turns out the compression technique had already been patented in 1985
- Unisys was the company that owned the patent, and boy were they pissed
- just kidding, they mostly just wanted commercial users like CompuServe to pay for a licence
- this leads to the development of the .PNG image file format

---

## ...but it was too late...

- by the later part of the 90's, the World Wide Web
- Gifs were perfect for simple web graphics
