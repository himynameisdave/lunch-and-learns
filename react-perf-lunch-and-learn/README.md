## Making React Performance Suck Less
> :pizza: _A dev lunch and learn by @dave_lunny given @7Geese_

This is a lunch and learn presentation I am going to be giving soon. It came out of my desire to dive deeper into React's inner workings, along with a tangible performance issue that I ran into in the wild.

### Development

Install everything with `yarn install`.

Then, to start up the local server, run `yarnpkg start`.

Open a browser and hit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), and we are ready to roll!

### Build & Deployment

Building the dist version of the project is as easy as running `yarnpkg build`

<!-- If you want to deploy the slideshow to surge, run `yarnpkg deploy`. -->
