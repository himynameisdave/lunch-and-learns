## async-workshop

A workshop about async/await in JavaScript for the front-end team at 7Geese.

### Do it

```
git clone git@github.com:himynameisdave/async-workshop.git
cd async-workshop
yarn install
```

### Purpose

[Async/await](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function) is a super cool new JavaScript feature. It makes asynchronous operations read like they are synchronous, which can make dealing with timing/execution of code a lot easier to reason about.

In this workshop I hope to show you:

- An overview of handling async code today;
- Why async/await is cooler, and how to use it;
- When to use it, when not to use it;
- Why you should care about it;
